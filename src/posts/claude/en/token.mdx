## The Problem

I'm using Claude Code extensively for development. Except for one thing... token management is terrible.
Even when I try to be careful, I run out of tokens in 1.5 to 2 hours and have to wait until they refresh.
During that time, I organize documentation and review code I've modified, but to further improve productivity, I'm looking for and applying token management techniques.

Regularly clean up context after completing each task.

### 1. You probably already know this

1. Reset context with the `/clear` command
2. Check current status with the `/context` command
- If any item exceeds 80%, proceed with clear
3. `/compact`
4. Set up Auto-compact through the `/config` command, and it will automatically clean up context

### 2. Claude Skills
Custom Commands vs MCP / Sub Agents / Skills

Custom Commands: Executed through commands each time.
MCP, Sub Agents, Skills: Operate automatically.

Traditional approach (Custom Commands / MCP / Sub Agents)
Claude Skills use lazy loading - only what's needed, when it's needed

Traditional approach (Custom Commands / Sub Agents)
- AI probabilistically writes context, so different answers may occur.

Claude Skills execute scripts directly.
- Execute pre-written scripts, code is not read, only execution results are stored in context.

Overwhelming token efficiency
100% identical results - same script execution
Solves inconsistency problems due to AI's non-deterministic nature
Optimal for large-scale automation and repetitive tasks

Claude Command: Shortcuts for frequently used prompts
Subagent: Specialized AI for specific roles
MCP: External system connection
Claude Skills: Work manual that helps do specific tasks better
- Sub agent: Hiring specialists
- Claude Skills: Sharing systematic work manuals with specialists

### Claude Code Workflow
- PRD document creation
- Test management tools

### Claude Code Plugin

/commit
/code-review - Create custom commands for repetitive tasks

/notion, supabase, etc. external systems -> MCP

Specialized knowledge -> Sub agent

But there's a problem.
How do you use these features in other projects?

Copy all defined features to the current project.
marketplace path: https://claudemarketplaces.com/

Templates that make it easy to share Claude Code's MCP, skills, and custom commands.

Recommended Claude Code plugin: frontend design

Create a beer curation service PRD as docs/PRO.md file.
Plan mode transition
PRD (Product Requirements Document)

  - Plugin: Complete extension package
  - Skills: Individual features included in the plugin (used automatically by Claude)


Each team has rules, so when a new project starts, defining the rules
and defining them as skills makes it good for team use.

Claude Skills
- Prompt creation feature
- SubAgent creation feature
- Claude Skills

Skill.md is the standard.
Write automation tasks in skills to handle work.

Claude Skills' Actual Role
Technical Specification

How-to guide for performing specific tasks
Specifies technology stack, libraries, best practices to use
Example: "When creating pptx, use python-pptx, layout like this, fonts like that"

Advantages of hierarchical structure
Claude Skills (top-level orchestrator)
├-> Sub Agent call (process complex logic)
├-> Plugin call (integrate external API)
└-> Direct processing (simple tasks)
As Jo said, Skill "defines technology selection and workflow according to the situation" and orchestrates lower-level tools as needed.
