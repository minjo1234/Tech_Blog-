## Background


Before the playwright MCP came out, I used playwright
to manage about 150 screen test cases that occurred in the portal.

I applied data types for objects that could occur in typescript,
and set it up so developers would manually modify test cases when objects changed.

But this method had problems.
It took time for developers to review the test cases for that feature again,
and it was too cumbersome to forget or pay attention to every data change.

## AI-based QA Engineering

Developer -> Execute playwright by typing commands in terminal -> Modify test code

- Problem: Must constantly check test case conventions for every feature modification, and manually set and change data when it changes.

Emergence of MCP

Developer -> Ask Claude Code to launch playwright and write new test cases referencing skills.

- Advantage: When feature modifications occur, ask Claude Code to automatically modify by looking at the data format and template file referencing skills.


In the past and present, I thought the domains of QA engineers and software developers were separate
but using this process, I thought developers could somewhat perform the role of QA engineers simultaneously.


With the emergence of Claude Skills
- Convention for Playwright writing TEST_GUIDE.md
- Use Faker library? - Need to check what Faker library is first
- Define selector priorities.

### SKILLS Definition

Defined SKILLS file according to playwright conventions used in the portal.
After that, I requested migration of existing code
and plan to find a way to launch playwright mcp afterward.

"Please test directly in the browser if LoginPage works properly"
"Please actually test the login function and confirm it works properly"
