## 1st Coding Test


### Introduction
I applied to Kakao's public recruitment coding test.
Since I was confident in my algorithmic problem-solving skills, I wanted to check my abilities..
I didn't particularly want to join Kakao, but I thought it would be good if I passed after doing well.

### Problem Solving Results
> Check out the [problem explanation](https://tech.kakao.com/2022/01/14/2022-kakao-recruitment-round-1/) on Kakao's tech blog if you're curious!

I studied full-stack based on web frontend, so I proceeded with Javascript.

#### Problem 1 - Receiving Report Results

(Success, 80.13% pass rate)

#### Problem 2 - Finding Prime Numbers in k-base

(Success, 55.82% pass rate)

#### Problem 3 - Parking Fee Calculation

(Success, 73.10% pass rate)

#### Problem 4 - Archery Competition

(Success, 21.16% pass rate)

I thought I solved it easily, but struggled with 1 test case that kept failing.
The cause was missing a detail in the sorting process, but I eventually found and fixed it.

#### Problem 5 - Sheep and Wolf

(Failed, 7.76% pass rate)

It felt like a Red-Black Tree problem, but I couldn't solve it.
JS seems really weak at tree problems..

#### Problem 6 - Indestructible Building

(Solved accuracy only, failed efficiency, accuracy 51.11%, efficiency 1.86%)

There were efficiency points.
If you solve it with conventional thinking, you won't get efficiency points. (That was me ㅜㅜ)
Had to use <u>2D prefix sums</u> well!


#### Problem 7 - Disappearing Scoreboard

(Failed, 0.78% pass rate ㄷㄷ)

See that pass rate? Consider it impossible for ordinary people,, ㅜㅜ
I could touch a few test cases, but gaps kept appearing when the map got bigger

Gave up cleanly

### 1st Coding Test Results and Review
Kakao's coding test shows you test input/output + all test case results. (about 20)
This means your code execution result is your score! No hidden cases.

Total test time was 5 hours, and I <u>solved 4.5 out of 7 problems</u>.

It was slightly disappointing, but I was confident that even with unlimited time, I couldn't solve the remaining 2.5 problems
so I thought the passing cutline wouldn't be higher than 4.5.

Results came out the next Friday after the test day, and as expected, I passed!
Looking at developer community reactions, <u>the cutline seemed to be around 4 solves</u>.

Although it was my first coding test, the problems were quite clean
and external assets like test cases and Q&A were well prepared
so I thought, "It's Kakao after all."

Since it's such a huge company, I didn't have high expectations for passing
and just wanted to check my skills, but it felt good to pass.

I could be confident that my skills aren't bad.
