## Purpose
---

1. I've been using platforms like tistory, velog, github.io for my tech blog, which were convenient, but I wanted to create my own with customized features.

2. Learning Next.js (Since we use Freemarker template engine at my company,
there was a significant difference in load speed between pages, sometimes over 10 seconds (eg map page) and it took a long time when frequent reloads were needed,
so I wanted to learn first and find a solution, and I thought Next.js was the right solution, so I'm making a learning blog in advance.)

## Feature List
---

**Essential Features**

- Post detail page
- Post list page
- Comment functionality
- Portfolio page (career management)

**Additional Features**
- Table of Contents sidebar (TOC)
- Dark/Light mode
- Scroll to top/bottom
- Copy post URL
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- reading-time parsing
- scroll progress status bar

## Choosing Tech Stack
---

### 1. Framework: Next.js


Next.js enables CSR, SSR, SSG per page and renders on the server like SSR but **provides additional features like Streaming, Prefetching, Client-side Transition** to deliver **smooth and fast user experience (UX) like an app**.

Version: Next.js v15.5.4

> Also, it's currently **one of the most prominent frameworks in the frontend market**, which was a factor in my choice.

### 2. Design: Tailwind CSS

I've been using Bootstrap, which is convenient for quick and general design, but has limited scope for customization, and additional CSS files were frequently created.
Tailwind requires more initial learning than Bootstrap, but I chose it because it allows much more free styling afterwards.

Version: tailwindcss@4.1.14

### 3. Writing: MDX

I plan to store mdx files in the project's internal directory, and won't add edit and delete functionality (since only I need to edit and delete).
I chose `mdx` files which can use jsx syntax in addition to basic `md`.

### 4. Parsing: Gray-matter

### 5. Comments: Giscus

### 6. Deployment: Vercel

Since Vercel is the Cloud Platform company that made Next.js, it has very high compatibility
and automatically performs the ci/cd pipeline when connected to a github repository, so I chose this.
