Instead of just reading Context for Claude Token management, I decided to create
custom Claude Skills tailored to the project.

But as I used it, I realized this tool that I thought was just for token management
was actually meant for automation.

Claude Skill vs Claude Sub Agent

Jo's ClovirONE Project Application Example
Recommended Skills to create:

ClovirONE-Development-Standard.md - Overall development conventions
VMware-Integration-Guide.md - vSphere API usage patterns
Frontend-Component-Style.md - Vue component structure

Recommended Sub Agents to create:

Infrastructure Agent - VM deployment, network configuration
Monitoring Agent - Metrics collection, dashboard optimization
Security Agent - Authentication/authorization, security policies
Database Agent - MariaDB query optimization, schema design

Jo's understanding is spot on! With this structure, you can save tokens, maintain consistency, and ensure expertise.
Is there a Skill or Sub Agent you'd like to create right now? I think we can actually write it!
