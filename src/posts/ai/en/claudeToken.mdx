## The Problem

I'm using Claude Code extensively for development. Except for one thing... token management is terrible.
Even when I try to be careful, I run out of tokens in 1.5 to 2 hours and have to wait until they refresh.
During that time, I organize documentation and review code I've modified, but to further improve productivity, I'm looking for and applying token management techniques.

Regularly clean up context after completing each task.

1. Reset context with the `/clear` command
2. Check current status with the `/context` command
- If any item exceeds 80%, proceed with clear
3. `/compact`
4. Set up Auto-compact through the `/config` command, and it will automatically clean up context
